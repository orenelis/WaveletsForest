# WaveletsForest
The wavelet decomposition of a Random Forest code enables regression or classification tasks for high dimensional datasets. Given the required settings of a typical random forest and data, it provides results that enable prediction of error of the model (with CV) as well as harmonic analysis in the form of the embedding of the underlying function in Besov space.
